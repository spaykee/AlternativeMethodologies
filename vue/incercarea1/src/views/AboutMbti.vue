            "The Jungian-Keirsey System" is a system that combines the best of
            two personality type theories together - The Psychological Type
            Theory postulated by Carl Jung and the Keirsey Temperament Theory
            postulated by David Keirsey.
          </h5>
          <br />
          <p>
            Carl Jung, a Swiss psychoanalyst, is credited with developing the
            personality type theory model that was published in 1923 in a book
            called "Psychological Types." At about the same time a woman named
            Katharine Briggs was developing her own theory of personalities by
            reading biographies and observing people she knew. When Katharine
            read Carl Jung's book she saw that his theory was consistent with
            hers in every way but was more complete. She, along with her
            daughter Isabel Myers, began studying the work of Carl Jung in
            earnest and eventually added their own concepts to his work,
            creating the Myers-Briggs System, which is a system of 16 different
            Myers-Briggs types. Interestingly, each of David Keirsey's four
            temperaments describe exactly four of Briggs and Myers types.
          </p>
          <p>
            Isabel Myers believed that if people could learn to understand and
            accept each other's differences that peace could be achieved in the
            world. So, when World War II began to rip the world apart, Isabel
            Myers, along with help from her mother, began developing a type
            indicator that would help people determine their psychological
            preferences so that they could find work that fully utilized their
            inborn talents and thus be most effective in the war effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            For two decades the type indicator they developed, later known as
            the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), was tested on college and
            medical school students to ensure reliability and validity before
            bringing it to a much wider audience. Until 1975 the MBTI was only
            available for research purposes. In 1975 Consulting Psychologists
            Press (CPP) took over publishing the MBTI and made it available to
            qualified practitioners that had been through a training course on
            the Myers-Briggs system. It was at that time that the MBTI became
            available to anyone, through these qualified practitioners.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Jungian-Keirsey system is a personality system that's based on
            the personality type theory model first developed by the famous
            Swiss psychoanalyst, Carl G. Jung, and later expanded by a mother
            and daughter team, Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers. It is also
            based on the temperament theory work of David Keirsey. Carl Jung's
            model was explained in detail in his book, "Psychological Types"
            that was published in 1923. David Keirsey's model was explained best
            in his book, "Please Understand Me II" that was published in 1998,
            20 years after his first book, "Please Understand Me." Like all of
            the systems on this website, the Jungian-Keirsey system is universal
            and applies equally well to everyone in the world - it is not
            limited to race, culture or creed. It describes different
            personality styles and behavioral characteristics extremely well and
            has a multitude of uses in real life
          </p>
          <p>
            The Jungian-Keirsey system was designed to help people value and
            appreciate themselves and others. Each Jungian-Keirsey type has
            individual patterns of behavior and character that are distinct from
            all other types. In some cases the behavior of two (or more) types
            is similar but the motivations behind that behavior are always
            different due to the different mental processes that dominate each
            unique type.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this system there are 16 different personality types that cluster
            into 4 different temperament categories (4 types to each temperament
            category). For simplicity, I have chosen to use the Myers-Briggs
            4-letter acronyms to describe each of my Jungian-Keirsey types
            because it is a nice, short descriptor. The 4-letter acronyms will
            be meaningful once you understand "How the Jungian-Keirsey System
            Works".

                      empathetic. They are very intuitive and highly attuned to
                      the emotions, needs, and motivations of others. They often

                          These insightful, deep thinkers are curious to find
                          answers to "the big questions," such as "Who am
                          I?".... "What makes us who we are?".... "What are my
                          unique talents?".... "What is the meaning of
                          life?".... "Does God exist?".... "How can I contribute
                          something meaningful and significant to life?" True
                          Blue/Deep Greens are the most logical, analytical and

                          their full potential and achieve personal fulfillment.
                          They also want to create more peace, love and goodwill
                          in the world. They enjoy working with people directly
                          but also have a strong need for independence and alone
                          time to read, study and learn. Many True Blue/Deep
                          Greens enjoy intensive research into subjects that
                          interest them. Intellectual stimulation, philosophical
                          contemplation and self-actualization are very
                          important to True Blue/Deep Greens. They enjoy using
                          their extensive base of knowledge to uplift, inspire,
                          motivate, empower and champion others. Healthy True
                          Blue/Deep Greens are: inspirational, humanitarian,

                          These service-oriented, loyal, dependable, hard
                          working people go about helping others and
                          contributing to the greater good in a traditional,
                          responsible, organized and friendly way. They have a
                          great deal of innate "emotional intelligence" and,
                          desiring harmony, usually get along well with all the
                          other temperament combinations. These people are
                          usually family and relationship-oriented and take
                          their commitments seriously. Like Solid Gold/True
                          Blues, True Blue/Solid Golds have an innate sense of
                          duty and strong desire to contribute to society so

                          through their local school, church, social service
                          clubs or civic groups. They give of their time and
                          energy freely and happily. They can be so caring,
                          supportive, dedicated and loyal to others that they
                          run the risk of over-working, burning out, or not
                          taking good enough care of themselves due to their
                          sense of duty and obligation. Learning how to delegate
                          responsibility and say "no" sometimes are important
                          lessons for True Blue/Solid Golds. They usually make
                          practical career choices. Healthy True Blue/Solid
                          Golds are: compassionate, sensible, prudent,

                          other True Blue combination types. They often love

                          are courageous, outspoken, social advocates and
                          activists. Yet others are artsy types that are into

                      ENFPs are highly imaginative, creative, insightful and
                      always full of new ideas and future possibilities for
                      people. One of their greatest challenges is staying with
                      one idea long enough to see it through to completion
                      before another new idea captures their enthusiastic
                      interest. They are energetic, vivacious, charming,
                      spontaneous and flexible. They have a talent for seeing

                      with their values. INFPs are reserved, sensitive,
                      creative, curious, sacrificial and adaptable. Like all

                          These insightful, deep thinkers are curious to find
                          answers to "the big questions," such as "Who am
                          I?".... "What makes us who we are?".... "What are my
                          unique talents?".... "What is the meaning of
                          life?".... "Does God exist?".... "How can I contribute
                          something meaningful and significant to life?" True
                          Blue/Deep Greens are the most logical, analytical and

                          time to read, study and learn. Many True Blue/Deep
                          Greens enjoy intensive research into subjects that
                          interest them. Intellectual stimulation, philosophical
                          contemplation and self-actualization are very
                          important to True Blue/Deep Greens. They enjoy using
                          their extensive base of knowledge to uplift, inspire,
                          motivate, empower and champion others. Healthy True
                          Blue/Deep Greens are: inspirational, humanitarian,

                          These service-oriented, loyal, dependable, hard
                          working people go about helping others and
                          contributing to the greater good in a traditional,
                          responsible, organized and friendly way. They have a
                          great deal of innate "emotional intelligence" and,
                          desiring harmony, usually get along well with all the
                          other temperament combinations. These people are
                          usually family and relationship-oriented and take
                          their commitments seriously. Like Solid Gold/True
                          Blues, True Blue/Solid Golds have an innate sense of

                          clubs or civic groups. They give of their time and
                          energy freely and happily. They can be so caring,

                          run the risk of over-working, burning out, or not
                          taking good enough care of themselves due to their
                          sense of duty and obligation. Learning how to delegate
                          responsibility and say "no" sometimes are important
                          lessons for True Blue/Solid Golds. They usually make

                      ENTJs are born leaders who like to be in charge. They are
                      decisive, frank, structured, goal-oriented and ambitious.
                      They want to be the best at whatever they do. ENTJs
                      quickly see illogical, inefficient procedures and
                      policies. They have a talent for developing and
                      implementing comprehensive systems to solve organizational
                      problems. They also have a talent for being innovative,
                      coordinating multiple projects and marshaling resources.
                      They are ingenious, strategic problem solvers. They like
                      intellectual exchange and often make great public speakers
                      and debaters. They often feel stressed and overwhelmed by

                          recognized for their ingenious ideas, Deep Green/True
                          Blues want to be well-informed about

                          more peace, happiness and goodwill for people and our
                          planet. As leaders, they are often interested in

                          causes and/or developing the capabilities of others.

                          problems that not only benefit humankind now but will
                          for future generations to come. Healthy Deep
                          Green/True Blues are: intelligent (sometimes

                          These people are both sensible, conscientious and
                          reliable as well as innovative, independent and
                          firm-minded. They are constantly coming up with
                          original solutions to problems and become frustrated
                          with organizations that are too rule-bound and
                          bureaucratic to change. These people are highly
                          productive since they have a natural hard-work ethic,
                          are effective time managers, can delay gratification
                          and do everything in their power to achieve their
                          goals on time. Deep Green/Solid Golds are excellent at
                          making decisions and analyzing raw data to draw
                          insightful yet objective conclusions. They have high
                          expectations of themselves and others and can easily
                          suffer from overwork, stress and/or burnout from being
                          too overly responsible and perfectionistic. They put a
                          lot of pressure on themselves and others to be ultra
                          competent, capable and dependable. Deep Green/Solid
                          Golds are private people who have a hard time asking
                          for help from others but it is vital that they do so
                          when necessary to maintain their health and sanity.
                          Healthy Deep Green/Solid Golds are: organized,

                          These unconventional people are natural problem
                          solvers, troubleshooters and inventors. That's because
                          they're resourceful, creative and continuously probing
                          for alternatives and possibilities when trying to
                          solve problems. They have a non-conformist spirit and
                          are most reluctant to do something in a particular way
                          just because that's the way it's always been done
                          before. On the contrary, they live by their own
                          standards and are constantly on the lookout for better
                          ways to do things. They love exploring new ideas,

                          entrepreneurial, risk-taking and independent. They
                          prefer to work for themselves but if they do work for
                          a company it needs to be one where they are given
                          leeway to work according to their own schedule. They
                          also need plenty of opportunities for creativity and
                          innovation. Deep Green/Bold Oranges love taking on new
                          challenges and are more eager to boldly take action
                          and just "go for it" than any other Deep Green
                          combination type. They are also the most
                          freedom-loving of the Deep Green combination types;
                          variety and change are their constant companions.
                          Healthy Deep Green/Bold Oranges are: ingenious,

                      ENTPs are born risk-takers who are alert to all
                      possibilities. Like ENFPs, their mind is constantly coming
                      up with new and creative ideas. Their greatest challenge
                      is trying to implement them all. They are entrepreneurial,
                      innovative, enterprising and resourceful; talented at
                      building prototypes and initiating new projects. ENTPs are
                      enthusiastic, charming, gregarious, comedic and witty but
                      they can also be outspoken and love a challenging debate.
                      They are inquisitive, curious, quick thinking and love
                      learning. ENTPs highly value their freedom and
                      independence. They are spontaneous and sometimes a little
                      too impulsive. ENTPs are good at reading other people.

                          These profound, idealistic, inventive thinkers are
                          often several steps ahead of their contemporaries.
                          They are creative, imaginative and insatiably curious.
                          Like True Blue/Deep Greens, Deep Green/True Blues ask
                          "the big questions" of life..... and get answers.
                          While all Deep Greens want to be well-informed and
                          recognized for their ingenious ideas, Deep Green/True
                          Blues want to be well-informed about
                          humanitarian/global issues and recognized for their
                          ingenious ideas, models and/or theories that create
                          more peace, happiness and goodwill for people and our
                          planet. As leaders, they are often interested in
                          international relations, world politics, environmental
                          causes and/or developing the capabilities of others.
                          The sometimes reserved, cool, aloof demeanor of Deep
                          Green/True Blues belies their truly compassionate,
                          sensitive and tender-hearted nature. With their highly
                          objective, scientific, analytical minds and ability to

                      INTJs are driven for self-improvement and maximizing
                      achievements. They are insightful, visionary, skeptical,
                      independent, and individualistic. They have original,
                      theoretical, scientific minds and are ingenious at
                      creative problem solving. They are most skilled in
                      creating theories and systems. They quickly see patterns
                      in external events and develop long-range strategies for
                      implementing their ideas and achieving their goals.
                      They're intense, single-minded, and determined. They have
                      high standards of competence and performance - for
                      themselves and others. They're responsible, organized and
                      good at follow through. They're reserved and private.

                          These profound, idealistic, inventive thinkers are
                          often several steps ahead of their contemporaries.
                          They are creative, imaginative and insatiably curious.
                          Like True Blue/Deep Greens, Deep Green/True Blues ask
                          "the big questions" of life..... and get answers.
                          While all Deep Greens want to be well-informed and
                          recognized for their ingenious ideas, Deep Green/True
                          Blues want to be well-informed about
                          humanitarian/global issues and recognized for their
                          ingenious ideas, models and/or theories that create
                          more peace, happiness and goodwill for people and our
                          planet. As leaders, they are often interested in
                          international relations, world politics, environmental
                          causes and/or developing the capabilities of others.
                          The sometimes reserved, cool, aloof demeanor of Deep
                          Green/True Blues belies their truly compassionate,
                          sensitive and tender-hearted nature. With their highly
                          objective, scientific, analytical minds and ability to
                          see the big picture, these unconventional, strategic,
                          visionary thinkers find great joy in solving complex
                          problems that not only benefit humankind now but will
                          for future generations to come. Healthy Deep
                          Green/True Blues are: intelligent (sometimes
                          brilliant), innovative, original, philosophical,
                          spiritual, humanitarian, benevolent, insightful,
                          intuitive and futuristic.

                          These people are both sensible, conscientious and
                          reliable as well as innovative, independent and
                          firm-minded. They are constantly coming up with
                          original solutions to problems and become frustrated
                          with organizations that are too rule-bound and
                          bureaucratic to change. These people are highly
                          productive since they have a natural hard-work ethic,
                          are effective time managers, can delay gratification
                          and do everything in their power to achieve their
                          goals on time. Deep Green/Solid Golds are excellent at
                          making decisions and analyzing raw data to draw
                          insightful yet objective conclusions. They have high
                          expectations of themselves and others and can easily
                          suffer from overwork, stress and/or burnout from being
                          too overly responsible and perfectionistic. They put a
                          lot of pressure on themselves and others to be ultra
                          competent, capable and dependable. Deep Green/Solid
                          Golds are private people who have a hard time asking
                          for help from others but it is vital that they do so
                          when necessary to maintain their health and sanity.
                          Healthy Deep Green/Solid Golds are: organized,
                          efficient, thorough, careful, self-reliant, decisive,

                          These unconventional people are natural problem
                          solvers, troubleshooters and inventors. That's because
                          they're resourceful, creative and continuously probing
                          for alternatives and possibilities when trying to
                          solve problems. They have a non-conformist spirit and
                          are most reluctant to do something in a particular way
                          just because that's the way it's always been done
                          before. On the contrary, they live by their own
                          standards and are constantly on the lookout for better
                          ways to do things. They love exploring new ideas,
                          methods and enterprises. Deep Green/Bold Oranges are
                          entrepreneurial, risk-taking and independent. They
                          prefer to work for themselves but if they do work for
                          a company it needs to be one where they are given
                          leeway to work according to their own schedule. They
                          also need plenty of opportunities for creativity and
                          innovation. Deep Green/Bold Oranges love taking on new
                          challenges and are more eager to boldly take action
                          and just "go for it" than any other Deep Green
                          combination type. They are also the most
                          freedom-loving of the Deep Green combination types;
                          variety and change are their constant companions.
                          Healthy Deep Green/Bold Oranges are: ingenious,
                          visionary, flexible, inventive and competitive (at the

                      INTPs are the masters of conceptual logic. They are
                      abstract, scientific, original thinkers who seek to
                      develop logical explanations for everything that interests
                      them. They often want to understand how everything in the
                      universe works. They are idiosyncratic, nonconforming and
                      very independent. They are curious, analytical and
                      insightful. They naturally notice inconsistencies,
                      contradictions and flaws of logic in others' thinking.
                      INTPs are also private and introspective. They can be so
                      caught up in thought that they can struggle with attending
                      to the physical world. They've been accused of being
                      absent-minded, like Albert Einstein, a quintessential
                      INTP.

                          for help from others but it is vital that they do so
                          when necessary to maintain their health and sanity.
                          Healthy Deep Green/Solid Golds are: organized,
                          efficient, thorough, careful, self-reliant, decisive,
                          punctual, tenacious, trustworthy and loyal.

                          These unconventional people are natural problem
                          solvers, troubleshooters and inventors. That's because
                          they're resourceful, creative and continuously probing
                          for alternatives and possibilities when trying to
                          solve problems. They have a non-conformist spirit and
                          are most reluctant to do something in a particular way
                          just because that's the way it's always been done
                          before. On the contrary, they live by their own
                          standards and are constantly on the lookout for better
                          ways to do things. They love exploring new ideas,
                          methods and enterprises. Deep Green/Bold Oranges are
                          entrepreneurial, risk-taking and independent. They
                          prefer to work for themselves but if they do work for
                          a company it needs to be one where they are given
                          leeway to work according to their own schedule. They
                          also need plenty of opportunities for creativity and
                          innovation. Deep Green/Bold Oranges love taking on new
                          challenges and are more eager to boldly take action
                          and just "go for it" than any other Deep Green
                          combination type. They are also the most
                          freedom-loving of the Deep Green combination types;
                          variety and change are their constant companions.
                          Healthy Deep Green/Bold Oranges are: ingenious,
                          visionary, flexible, inventive and competitive (at the
                          very least with themselves)

                      ESTJs excel at organizing projects and people to get
                      things done. Like ENTJs, they like being in charge and can
                      be outspoken and assertive. They like to quickly make and
                      implement decisions. They are outgoing, logical,
                      practical, and dependable. They focus on getting results
                      in the most efficient, orderly way possible. They're
                      responsible, hardworking and goal-oriented. They have a
                      clear set of rules and procedures that they systematically
                      follow and want others to also. They like activities to go
                      according to plan and get frustrated when things don't
                      work out the way they expected them to. Like all Solid
                      Golds, they value family, convention and tradition.

                          These friendly, pragmatic, service-oriented people
                          truly care about the welfare of others. With their
                          innate sense of duty and desire to contribute to
                          society they are often involved in their community,
                          whether through their local school, church, social
                          service clubs or civic groups. These people give of
                          their time and energy freely and happily. That's
                          because they are compassionate, empathetic and love
                          helping people. Home, family and relationships are all
                          extremely important to Solid Gold/True Blues. They do
                          everything in their power to make sure their family
                          and friends and well taken care of. They also make
                          sure their house is neat and tidy. They are hard
                          working and willing to do the dirty work and detail
                          work that others don't want to do. Solid Gold/True
                          Blues are sentimental about observing family
                          traditions and rituals at the holidays. Most Solid
                          Gold parents have clear "shoulds" and "shouldn'ts"
                          that their children have to abide by but Solid
                          Gold/True Blues are more understanding and accepting
                          of their kids' differences. Like True Blue/Solid
                          Golds, Solid Gold/True Blues need to be careful not to
                          overdo for others and neglect themselves. Healthy
                          Solid Gold/True Blues are: affectionate, caring,
                          sensible, responsible, loyal, dependable, organized,
                          thorough and conscientious.

                          intellectual, logical, and rely heavily on facts,
                          figures and information. They are both innovative and
                          practical, academic and results-oriented. They like to
                          be mentally challenged. They are great at coordinating
                          projects, gathering and analyzing data, and working
                          with detailed systems. Many put their mental
                          competence to good use in such fields as technology,
                          math, science, law, engineering or computer science,
                          to name a few. Some assertive and decisive Solid
                          Gold/Deep Greens like to lead or administrate. They
                          are supervisors, managers or directors who know how to
                          manage people, direct operations, monitor people's
                          performance, enforce policies and procedures, and get
                          things done efficiently. Other Solid Gold/Deep Greens
                          like to coordinate operations to get the maximum
                          productivity with a minimum waste of time, energy and
                          resources. They like to make systems work more
                          efficiently and some excel in quality control and
                          regulatory compliance. Healthy Solid Gold/Deep Greens
                          are: loyal, reliable, stable, family-oriented,
                          responsible, competent, firm-minded, principled and
                          objective.

                          These responsible, practical people can either
                          harmoniously blend the best of their two different
                          selves or be at odds with themselves. At best, Solid
                          Gold/Bold Oranges are both structured and flexible,
                          sensible and adventurous, well organized and open to
                          change, cautious and spontaneous, industrious and
                          playful, etc. As these people are Solid Golds
                          primarily, they like to have a plan and schedule for
                          the day but because they are Bold Oranges secondarily
                          they adapt well to changing circumstances. Solid
                          Gold/Bold Oranges are able to go with the flow,
                          overcome challenges, and deal with chaos better than
                          any other Solid Gold combination type. These people
                          want to live a carefree, exciting life like Bold
                          Oranges but can often find that their dutiful nature
                          bogs them down with red tape and rules to adhere to.
                          When young this combination type is often torn between
                          doing the right thing versus doing the risky,
                          non-conforming thing. These people like to take
                          advantage of opportunities so they generally like to
                          keep organized and on top of things so that they can
                          act on a moment's notice should the opportunity arise.
                          Healthy Solid Gold/Bold Oranges are: self-confident,
                          able to take charge, generous, loyal, dependable,
                          sociable, realistic, sensible, down-to-earth, helpful
                          and trustworthy.

                      ESFJs enjoy helping others. They like to be needed and
                      appreciated so they naturally notice what others need in
                      their day-to-day lives and try to provide it. That is one
                      of their talents. They are energetic, enthusiastic,
                      sociable and engaging. They enjoy developing and nurturing
                      relationships. ESFJs are personable, sympathetic and
                      cooperative. They like working with others, value harmony,
                      and are often active in service organizations and the
                      community in which they live. They are conscientious,
                      loyal and responsible. They like to be organized, orderly,
                      accurate and complete tasks on time. ESFJs enjoy praise
                      but can take criticism very personally at times.

                          Golds, Solid Gold/True Blues need to be careful not to
                          overdo for others and neglect themselves. Healthy
                          Solid Gold/True Blues are: affectionate, caring,

                          with detailed systems. Many put their mental

                          selves or be at odds with themselves. At best, Solid
                          Gold/Bold Oranges are both structured and flexible,
                          sensible and adventurous, well organized and open to
                          change, cautious and spontaneous, industrious and

                          primarily, they like to have a plan and schedule for
                          the day but because they are Bold Oranges secondarily
                          they adapt well to changing circumstances. Solid
                          Gold/Bold Oranges are able to go with the flow,
                          overcome challenges, and deal with chaos better than

                          want to live a carefree, exciting life like Bold
                          Oranges but can often find that their dutiful nature
                          bogs them down with red tape and rules to adhere to.
                          When young this combination type is often torn between
                          doing the right thing versus doing the risky,
                          non-conforming thing. These people like to take
                          advantage of opportunities so they generally like to
                          keep organized and on top of things so that they can
                          act on a moment's notice should the opportunity arise.
                          Healthy Solid Gold/Bold Oranges are: self-confident,

                      ISTJs are perhaps the most reliable, responsible, loyal
                      and dutiful of all the types. That's because they honor
                      their commitments and do what is right. They are
                      hardworking, trustworthy and can be counted on without
                      question. They have an eye for detail and are systematic,
                      painstakingly thorough and good at follow-through. They
                      have a talent for storing information and are a veritable
                      storehouse of data, facts and trivia. They take great
                      pleasure in making everything orderly and organized -
                      their work, home and life. ISTJs are conservative,
                      reserved and logical. Like all Solid Golds, they value
                      convention, tradition and being active in the community.

                          bogs them down with red tape and rules to adhere to.
                          When young this combination type is often torn between
                          doing the right thing versus doing the risky,
                          non-conforming thing. These people like to take
                          advantage of opportunities so they generally like to
                          keep organized and on top of things so that they can
                          act on a moment's notice should the opportunity arise.
                          Healthy Solid Gold/Bold Oranges are: self-confident,
                          able to take charge, generous, loyal, dependable,
                          sociable, realistic, sensible, down-to-earth, helpful
                          and trustworthy.

                      Like ISTJs, ISFJs are also reliable, responsible, loyal
                      and dutiful. The "F" in ISFJ (as opposed to the "T" in
                      ISTJ) makes ISFJs quietly friendly, tactful and concerned
                      with others' welfare. They notice and remember specifics
                      about people who are important to them. They are reserved,
                      modest and unassuming so they often find themselves
                      working behind the scenes, helping others. They have a
                      talent for being patient and listening well and often
                      enter the helping professions. They are thorough,
                      painstaking and accurate in their work. They strive to
                      create an orderly and harmonious environment at work and
                      at home. They are traditional and conventional.

                          These friendly, pragmatic, service-oriented people
                          truly care about the welfare of others. With their
                          innate sense of duty and desire to contribute to
                          society they are often involved in their community,
                          whether through their local school, church, social
                          service clubs or civic groups. These people give of
                          their time and energy freely and happily. That's
                          because they are compassionate, empathetic and love
                          helping people. Home, family and relationships are all
                          extremely important to Solid Gold/True Blues. They do
                          everything in their power to make sure their family
                          and friends and well taken care of. They also make
                          sure their house is neat and tidy. They are hard
                          working and willing to do the dirty work and detail
                          work that others don't want to do. Solid Gold/True
                          Blues are sentimental about observing family
                          traditions and rituals at the holidays. Most Solid
                          Gold parents have clear "shoulds" and "shouldn'ts"
                          that their children have to abide by but Solid
                          Gold/True Blues are more understanding and accepting
                          of their kids' differences. Like True Blue/Solid
                          Golds, Solid Gold/True Blues need to be careful not to
                          overdo for others and neglect themselves. Healthy
                          Solid Gold/True Blues are: affectionate, caring,
                          sensible, responsible, loyal, dependable, organized,
                          thorough and conscientious.

                          intellectual, logical, and rely heavily on facts,
                          figures and information. They are both innovative and
                          practical, academic and results-oriented. They like to
                          be mentally challenged. They are great at coordinating
                          projects, gathering and analyzing data, and working
                          with detailed systems. Many put their mental
                          competence to good use in such fields as technology,
                          math, science, law, engineering or computer science,
                          to name a few. Some assertive and decisive Solid
                          Gold/Deep Greens like to lead or administrate. They
                          are supervisors, managers or directors who know how to
                          manage people, direct operations, monitor people's
                          performance, enforce policies and procedures, and get
                          things done efficiently. Other Solid Gold/Deep Greens
                          like to coordinate operations to get the maximum
                          productivity with a minimum waste of time, energy and
                          resources. They like to make systems work more
                          efficiently and some excel in quality control and
                          regulatory compliance. Healthy Solid Gold/Deep Greens
                          are: loyal, reliable, stable, family-oriented,
                          responsible, competent, firm-minded, principled and
                          objective.

                          harmoniously blend the best of their two different
                          selves or be at odds with themselves. At best, Solid
                          Gold/Bold Oranges are both structured and flexible,
                          sensible and adventurous, well organized and open to
                          change, cautious and spontaneous, industrious and

                          primarily, they like to have a plan and schedule for
                          the day but because they are Bold Oranges secondarily
                          they adapt well to changing circumstances. Solid
                          Gold/Bold Oranges are able to go with the flow,
                          overcome challenges, and deal with chaos better than
                          any other Solid Gold combination type. These people

                      ESTPs are master promoters, negotiators and deal-makers.
                      They're energetic and constantly on the go. They learn
                      best by doing and like risk, challenge and adventure. They

                      concrete results. ESTPs want tangible measures of success
                      and work hard to get them. They're alert, confident, witty

                          open-minded and interested in personal growth, so
                          important to their True Blue aspect. The need for
                          independence and freedom of Bold Oranges can often be
                          at odds with the need for connecting with others in a
                          deep, intimate way of True Blues. Both freedom and
                          closeness are desired. These people are often creative
                          and/or artistic. Healthy Bold Orange/True Blues are:
                          playful, fun-loving, energetic, entertaining,
                          instinctive, spontaneous, passionate and engaging.

                          These irreverent, unconventional people focus on doing
                          what works as opposed to doing what's right, like True
                          Blues and Solid Golds. They are natural problem
                          solvers and troubleshooters. They also like to thwart

                          action that makes them natural entrepreneurs. These

                          next project. For this reason, Bold Orange/Deep Greens
                          do well to have someone with great organization

                          Orange/Solid Golds are usually aware of their actions.
                          These people tend to work hard, are good at detail
                          work, masters of tools and heavy equipment, and enjoy
                          solving practical problems. If they are extraverted

                          negotiating, service work, trade work or organizing
                          special events. These people are the most

                          dependable spouses and parents. Bold Oranges are

                      ESFPs are caring, generous and enjoy helping others. They
                      are also gregarious, energetic, vivacious, and outgoing.
                      ESFPs are exuberant lovers of life, people, and material
                      comforts. Like ESTPs, they learn best by doing. Because of
                      their warmth, optimism, charm, expressiveness and
                      acceptance of others, they are usually well-liked. ESFPs
                      are natural actors and performers who enjoy entertaining
                      others. They enjoy new experiences and want to fully enjoy
                      life in the here-and-now. They bring common sense and a
                      practical, realistic approach to their work but they also
                      try to make work fun. They are flexible and spontaneous
                      and adapt well to new people and environments.

                      ISTPs enjoy working with machines, tools and anything
                      requiring hands-on skills. They seek action, excitement,
                      adventure and challenge. They enjoy observing and
                      analyzing how things work. They enjoy taking things apart
                      and actively solving problems with a practical, hands-on
                      approach. ISTPs are reserved, private and curious
                      observers of life. They can be witty but not wordy. ISTPs
                      are storehouses of information. They are interested in
                      cause and effect and organize information using logical
                      principles. They are realistic and usually street smart
                      too. They are resourceful, adaptable and flexible. They
                      are often athletic and competitive yet value efficiency of
                      effort.

                          and idealism. They are also very generous, a trait of
                          both Bold Oranges and True Blues. These people are
                          socially active and interactive. They are usually
                          drawn to careers where their warm and friendly nature
                          is appreciated and where they can be of practical
                          service to others. They dislike interpersonal conflict
                          and thrive in a supportive, affirming, adaptable
                          environment. Work that is consistent with their strong
                          personal values is important. Bold Orange/True Blues
                          often enjoy jobs in fields such as sales, marketing,
                          travel, civil service, social service, education and
                          health care, to name a few. Bold Orange/True Blues are
                          open-minded and interested in personal growth, so
                          important to their True Blue aspect. The need for
                          independence and freedom of Bold Oranges can often be
                          at odds with the need for connecting with others in a
                          deep, intimate way of True Blues. Both freedom and
                          closeness are desired. These people are often creative
                          and/or artistic. Healthy Bold Orange/True Blues are:
                          playful, fun-loving, energetic, entertaining,
                          instinctive, spontaneous, passionate and engaging.

                          These irreverent, unconventional people focus on doing
                          what works as opposed to doing what's right, like True
                          Blues and Solid Golds. They are natural problem
                          solvers and troubleshooters. They also like to thwart
                          bureaucrats and improve standard operating procedures.
                          This combination makes these people both tactical and
                          strategic. That means they are gifted at using tools
                          and operating all kinds of equipment to get things
                          done in a moment's notice but it also means they are
                          gifted at making long-range plans and constructing
                          technologies in order to achieve their thought out
                          objectives. They are brimming with creative energy and
                          have the self-confidence and desire to take immediate
                          action that makes them natural entrepreneurs. These
                          people are full of possibilities, alternatives and
                          solutions to complex problems. Their greatest
                          challenge is implementing the opportunities they dream
                          up before they get bored and want to move on to the
                          next project. For this reason, Bold Orange/Deep Greens
                          do well to have someone with great organization
                          skills, a detail-oriented mind and excellent
                          follow-through (like any of the Solid Gold
                          combinations) to help them. Healthy Bold Orange/Deep
                          Greens are: action-oriented, calculated risk-takers,
                          ambitious, pragmatic, logical, great communicators and
                          negotiators, nonconforming, able to read people well,
                          able to take charge and seize opportunities.

                          These fun-loving, spontaneous people love to seize the
                          moment (and they might even think about the
                          consequences for the future because of their Solid
                          Gold aspect). Their attitude that tomorrow may never
                          come only encourages them to act on impulse but Bold
                          Orange/Solid Golds are usually aware of their actions.
                          These people tend to work hard, are good at detail
                          work, masters of tools and heavy equipment, and enjoy
                          solving practical problems. If they are extraverted
                          they can be especially good at marketing, sales,
                          negotiating, service work, trade work or organizing
                          special events. These people are the most
                          family-oriented of the Bold Oranges. They are still
                          freedom-loving Bold Oranges but the Solid Gold aspect
                          of their personality allows them to be responsible and
                          dependable spouses and parents. Bold Oranges are
                          notorious for losing track of time and showing up late
                          to events and appointments but Bold Orange/Solid Golds
                          may be one of the few Bold Orange combination types
                          that are good at being on time. Bold Orange/Solid
                          Golds are often avid athletes and sports fans. They
                          usually play and/or watch football, basketball and
                          baseball. Charming, fun and funny, these are some of
                          the most popular people in high school. Healthy Bold
                          Orange/Solid Golds are: self-assured, adaptable,
                          optimistic, generous, loyal, reliable, sociable,
                          pragmatic, shrewd, down-to-earth and trustworthy.

                      ISFPs are quiet, sensitive, gentle, friendly and kind.
                      They are loyal, sympathetic and compassionate. They are
                      practical and service-oriented but like to have their own
                      space and work within their own time frame. They are

                      live-and-let-live attitude and are sensitive to conflicts
                      and disagreements. They enjoy the present moment and
                      simple pleasures of life, like the beauty of nature and
                      love of animals. They're often artistic and/or graceful.
                      They feel things deeply and have strong values. They love
                      their freedom but are loyal to people who are important to
                      them. They're modest, unassuming, spontaneous and

                          These irreverent, unconventional people focus on doing
                          what works as opposed to doing what's right, like True
                          Blues and Solid Golds. They are natural problem
                          solvers and troubleshooters. They also like to thwart
                          bureaucrats and improve standard operating procedures.
                          This combination makes these people both tactical and
                          strategic. That means they are gifted at using tools
                          and operating all kinds of equipment to get things
                          done in a moment's notice but it also means they are
                          gifted at making long-range plans and constructing
                          technologies in order to achieve their thought out
                          objectives. They are brimming with creative energy and
                          have the self-confidence and desire to take immediate
                          action that makes them natural entrepreneurs. These
                          people are full of possibilities, alternatives and
                          solutions to complex problems. Their greatest
                          challenge is implementing the opportunities they dream
                          up before they get bored and want to move on to the
                          next project. For this reason, Bold Orange/Deep Greens
                          do well to have someone with great organization
                          skills, a detail-oriented mind and excellent
                          follow-through (like any of the Solid Gold
                          combinations) to help them. Healthy Bold Orange/Deep
                          Greens are: action-oriented, calculated risk-takers,
                          ambitious, pragmatic, logical, great communicators and
                          negotiators, nonconforming, able to read people well,
                          able to take charge and seize opportunities.

                          These fun-loving, spontaneous people love to seize the
                          moment (and they might even think about the
                          consequences for the future because of their Solid
                          Gold aspect). Their attitude that tomorrow may never
                          come only encourages them to act on impulse but Bold
                          Orange/Solid Golds are usually aware of their actions.
                          These people tend to work hard, are good at detail
                          work, masters of tools and heavy equipment, and enjoy
                          solving practical problems. If they are extraverted
                          they can be especially good at marketing, sales,
                          negotiating, service work, trade work or organizing
                          special events. These people are the most
                          family-oriented of the Bold Oranges. They are still
                          freedom-loving Bold Oranges but the Solid Gold aspect
                          of their personality allows them to be responsible and
                          dependable spouses and parents. Bold Oranges are
                          notorious for losing track of time and showing up late
                          to events and appointments but Bold Orange/Solid Golds
                          may be one of the few Bold Orange combination types
                          that are good at being on time. Bold Orange/Solid
                          Golds are often avid athletes and sports fans. They
                          usually play and/or watch football, basketball and
                          baseball. Charming, fun and funny, these are some of
                          the most popular people in high school. Healthy Bold
                          Orange/Solid Golds are: self-assured, adaptable,
                          optimistic, generous, loyal, reliable, sociable,
                          pragmatic, shrewd, down-to-earth and trustworthy.
